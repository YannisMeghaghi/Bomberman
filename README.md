# Bomberman
During my last high school's year i took the option called "ISN" in french which can be translated as :"Computer and Numeric Sciences".
In order to validate this course, me and my group (we were three) had to do a project in Python of our choice.
We decided to try to re-create a famous game called "Bomberman".
The final result was satisfyin gwhen i was a total beginner but now i realize that there is still a lot to work on in ordrer to transform this project in a good game.

You can test it by executing the file "BillyTheBomb" simply in the IDLE, but there are still errors in certains cases and the system of "kills" doesn't work well.
